# Installation
Below are instructions on how to install DecimalSystems. For usage instructions, reference [Getting Started](/docs/start#examples) and [Num](/docs/num).

##### 

## Node
DecimalSystem can be used in both Node and in a browser. To install and use it in Node, do the following:
```shell script
npm i decimalsystem
```
and use it with:
```javascript
import {Num} from "decimalsystem";

new Num(14)...
```

#### 

## Browser
With tools such as Webpack, DecimalSystem's installation instructions for the browser are identical as they are for Node. If you aren't able to use NPM packages, then the below script must be added to your page:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/decimalsystem@1.0.12/dist/decimalsystem.min.js" integrity="sha256-nRyjkyEyUvRF9D0jOSXsPUKj9FJ2DAL16wCsen7MCkU=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
and can be used it with:
```javascript
import {Num} from "decimalsystem";

new decimalsystem.Num(14)...
```
